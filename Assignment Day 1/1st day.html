    <h1>Technology Is EveryThing.</h1>
    <p>
      Technology ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand";
      and -λογία, -logia[2]) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and<br> processes used in 
      the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific 
      investigation. Technology can be the<br> knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can 
      be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.<br> Systems
      (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use,
      and then producing an outcome are referred to<br> as technology systems or technological systems.

      Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy)
      and has allowed the rise of a leisure<br> class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known 
      as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's <br>environment. Innovations have always 
      influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the
      rise of<br> the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<br>
      Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology 
      improves the human condition or worsens it.<br> Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary 
      movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and<br> alienates 
      people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological 
      progress as beneficial to society<br> and the human condition.

      The term "technology" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution. 
      The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when<br> American social scientists, beginning with Thorsteinblen, 
      translated ideas from the German concept of Technik into "technology." In German and other European 
      languages,<br> a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in English, which usually 
      translates both terms as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not only to <br>the study of the 
      industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves.
